![Not That Reboot](http://upload.zype.com/53c0457a69702d4d66040000/zobject_image/554a873769702d0499c97b00/1430947637/original.png?1430947637 "Definitely not Code Lyoko")
Back when I was a senior undergraduate I began the habit of rewatching old cartoons from my child hood starting with [Code Lyoko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Lyoko). While definitely graced by nostalgia, it was still pretty decent. Plus watching it as an adult, gave me an entirely new perspective. 

So naturally, I decided to queue up another show for binge watching, [ReBoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBoot). From childhood, I remember this show being the equivalent of visual garbage, but what could you expect from that perfect 00's era CGI.

Reading through plot synopses, the show sounded very intriguing aside from things like one of the characters being named Bob, _who just happens to be the main character_, when everyone else has a computer pun as their name.

But boy, watching it is a crazy experience altogether. Code Lyoko's 3D segments made me sick at first, but thanks to beautiful 2D segments, the 3D improving in quality, and my own acclimation, I got used to it. Even to the point were the fancy 3D graphics of Code Lyoko: Evolution, _the bastard live action "sequel", just looked generic. I don't care if it follows the books or is canon or whatever, the first episode was worse than laughably bad. 

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever get used to ReBoot's graphics. 00's graphics aside, a lot of the characters, _such as Bob (the blue guy with the toxic sludge for hair in the middle there)_, are firmly planted in the uncanny valley. Even disregarding the fact that he's fricken **blue**. These are supposed to be the good guys.

_This dapper ol' chap is bloody brilliant though (and purple (violet (indigo)))._


Not only do the evil characters look much better, but they have better dialogue, better personality, better acting, I could go on for days.

![Daemon](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/reboot/images/c/cb/Daemon.jpg "Goddess of the End") 
_Daemon is the entire reason, I'm even watching this series. She's my favorite looking character and a great villain as well. Her synopsis on Wikipedia is amazing._

If only wasn't so painful to look at or even listen to our "heroes".

In 6 months, I've probably watched 4 or 5 episodes. I don't intend to quit but it is pretty difficult.

_Like serious what is this even? Who though that this was good from a design standpoint. They could do literally anything else to make it look better. I understand it's supposed to be bright red hair, it is bright and it is red but I'm not so sure about the hair part._
