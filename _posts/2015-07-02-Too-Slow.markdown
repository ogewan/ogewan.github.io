So developing comix-ngn, I've been researching Web Page Optimization and [FSPOF(Front-end Single Points of Failure)](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/06/01/frontend-spof/). This site, the result of a free jekyll theme, follows the convention of websites these days of being poorly programmed. It looks pretty, but my internet disconnected while posting this and it takes SECONDS TO REALIZE that jQuery isn't there. Seconds being equivalent to years, especially when I'm rapidly testing stuff.

This will not stand!
So I will fix it.
